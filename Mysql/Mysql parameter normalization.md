| 1    | maxActive                     | The maximum number of active connections that the connection pool can allocate at the same time | 100     | 300      |                                                              |
| 2    | maxIdle                       | "The maximum number of connections to always keep in the pool, if enabled, limit connections will be checked periodically, Connections that exceed the value set by this property and the idle time exceeds minEvictableIdleTimeMillis will be released" | 100     | 300      |                                                              |
| 3    | minIdle                       | "Always keep the minimum number of connections in the pool. If the number of connections in the pool is lower than this value, a new connection will be created. Narrows down to this value if connection validation fails" | 100     | 100      |                                                              |
| 4    | initialSize                   | The initial number of connections created when the connection pool starts | 10      | 10       |                                                              |
| 5    | maxWait                       | Maximum wait time (milliseconds), if waiting longer than this time without a connection available, an exception is thrown | 30000   | 10000    |                                                              |
| 6    | testWhileIdle                 | Whether to verify the idle connection in the pool, if the verification fails, the connection will be recycled | FALSE   | TRUE     | Enable idle detection                                        |
| 7    | timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis | "Sleep time (in milliseconds) while idle connection collector thread is running. The value should not be less than 1 second, it determines how often the thread validates idle connections or drops connections" | 5000    | 300000   | Indicates a 5-minute idle connection detection period        |
| 8    | minEvictableIdleTimeMillis    | Minimum time (in milliseconds) for a connection to remain idle in the pool without being recycled | 60000   | 240000   | Indicates that the connection is idle for a maximum of 4 minutes (note that it needs to be lower than the idle connection detection period) |
| 9    | testOnBorrow                  | Whether to verify when a connection is taken from the connection pool, if the verification fails, delete the connection from the pool and try to take another connection | FALSE   | TRUE     |                                                              |
