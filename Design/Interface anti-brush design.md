# Interface anti-brush design

## Common anti-brush strategies

* Request parameters with signature for identity verification

    Can use SHA256, RSA algorithm for encryption
* Integrated man-machine verification
    
    Such as Google reCaptcha
* Request behavior control

    Including real-time behavioral analysis and offline analysis
