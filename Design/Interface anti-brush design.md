# Interface anti-brush design

## Common anti-brush strategies

* Request parameters with signature for identity verification

    Can use SHA256, RSA algorithm for encryption
* Integrated man-machine verification
    
    Such as Google reCaptcha
* Request behavior control

    Including real-time behavioral analysis and offline analysis

## Practical anti-brush design
> The reality is that the old version is already on the app market, and there is no way to update the code

We can only think about behavioral risk control
